# Formats and editorial conventions

## Citable texts

- texts are citable by URN
- files are in CEX format.  They have a header line `#!ctsdata` followed by one line per citable passage.  Each line has two columns delimited by the `#` character. The first column is the passage's URN, the second its text contents.


## Orthographies and character usage



- `latin23`: Latin alphabet with 23 alphabetic characters, and no distinction of *i/j* or *u/v*
- `latin24`: Latin alphabet with 24 alphabetic characters.  Vocalic *u* and consonantal *v* are distinct, but there is but no distinction of *i/j*.
- `latin25`: Latin alphabet with 25 alphabetic characters, including vocalic *u* and *i*, and consonantal *v* and *j*.
